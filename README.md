AwesomeTTS
==========

A TTS plugin for Anki

This is a fork of AwesomeTTS. 

Currently, it differs only in the way the filenames are generated.

This version md5sums the output-mp3 and uses the hash for nameing the files.

The original version converted the input text to (very very very) long filenames.
